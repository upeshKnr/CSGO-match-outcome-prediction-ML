# 🔫 CSGO Match Win Prediction using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning to predict the outcome of CSGO competitive matches based on match statistics and team features.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze CSGO match data and build a model that predicts the probability of a team winning a match using in-game stats.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Tech Stack

- Python, pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN)  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (visualizations)  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Project Highlights

- Performed feature engineering on key indicators (kill/death ratio, headshot %, bomb plants, etc.)
- Visualized match trends and class balance using plots
- Applied classification models to predict win outcomes (binary: Win/Lose)
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and AUC

---

## ✅ Outcome

Achieved ~80%+ accuracy on unseen match data using a tuned Random Forest Classifier. Built insights into which in-game stats most affect outcomes.
